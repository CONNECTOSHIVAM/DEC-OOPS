//Question 1:- Write a java program to print the "Radhe radhe".

public class Question1 {

    // It is main methood
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Radhe radhe");
    }
}

/*
 * Defination of this code:-
 * 1.public :- public key word is access modifier to access function by JVM(java
 * vartual machine).
 * 2. class:- class is key word used for create a class with class name :- class
 * className :- class Question1.
 * 3. void :- void is the return type of the functions.
 * 4. String[] args:- It is used for take argument from command line passed to
 * the main methood.
 * 5.System.out.println() :- It is a inbuilt methood for print any message.
